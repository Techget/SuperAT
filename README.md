## File structure
- discriminator.py
    - Include the common classification methods, currenlty using resnet18
    - Obtain pretrained resnet18 from [Pytorch_CIFAR10](https://github.com/huyvnphan/PyTorch_CIFAR10#pytorch-models-trained-on-cifar-10-dataset)
    - todo: use pre activated resnet 
- vae.py
    - Include vanilla implementation of VAE
    - reference to lightning VAE
- main_pretrained_discriminator.py
    - pretrain VAE to return image with little modification to fool the trained model
    - both GENERATOR and Discriminator are updated
    - `python3 main_pretrained_discriminator.py` to start training
- test_adversarial_trained_model.py
    - verify adversarial trained model on common data, not adversarial example
